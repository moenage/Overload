# Overload
 Godot Wild Jam #65

Due to the Unity fiasco that happened in 2023, I wanted to explore other engines and the one everyone was hyping up is Godot. So I thought the best way was to join a game jam. I wanted to build something I was familiar with to help me judge Unity vs Godot for me. The theme was 'Overload' and I got the idea almost instantly. The player doesn't have health, but they have an overload bar that fills up when they get hit. Once it fills up, the player goes ballistic shooting all over the place. The catch is there is a bouncing UFO that you can damage, so you need to avoid shooting it and it gets really difficult when you overload! Players can slow down the overload timer by killing enemies. You can play the game in your browser by clicking the link below :)


- You Control a spaceship

- There is a bouncing UFO that you need to AVOID shooting

- When you fill your overload bar, you start going ballistic, so more chance of damaging the UFO

The only way to reduce the Overload meter is to shoot down enemies
